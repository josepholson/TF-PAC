% 1_Time_freq_MVL
% This script computes time-frequency based phase amplitude coupling using MVL method.
% First a synthesized signal is produced with PAC generated between 5Hz
% and 70Hz; TF-MVL algorithm is then applied to determine the coupling. 
% A comodulogram is plotted to show the coupling between high and low frequency.
% Surrogate testing is not used here.
