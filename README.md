# TF-MVL
MATLAB scripts for computing phase amplitude coupling (PAC) in using complex time-frequency distribution.
Written and maintained by: Tamanna T. K. Munia, January 2019
The script can be easily adopted to generate a synthesized signal and compute phase amplitude coupling using tf-MVL method 
by modifying Time_freq_MVL script.
Required time-frequency distribution files can be found in 'tfdnmfiles.zip ' folder.
Currently the script only accepts single channel data.
